# 🧪 Lab: 103.2 Process Text Streams Using Filters

## 🎯 What I Did in This Lab  
I worked hands-on with various text filter commands such as `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and `sed`. I simulated real-world use cases by creating and manipulating text files, sorting and transforming content, and verifying checksums. 🧩

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 1️⃣ Filter and Display Basic File Content  
🔹 Explore basic file reading and redirection  

## 2️⃣ Modify and Analyze Output Streams  
🔹 Use various commands to modify how text is displayed  

## 3️⃣ Stream Text Through Filters  
🔹 Apply filters to transform, clean, and sort data  

## 4️⃣ Split, Combine, and Manipulate Files  
🔹 Break files apart and glue them back together  

## 5️⃣ Checksum and Compression Filters  
🔹 Use hashing and view compressed files

## 🧠 What I Learned  
This lab taught me how to effectively manipulate text streams using a wide range of filters and utilities. I learned how to analyze file content, format output, transform text, and even verify file integrity with hash functions. 💡 These tools are incredibly useful in real-world sysadmin and scripting tasks!
